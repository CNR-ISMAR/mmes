In this folder are published tha current bash scripts used for the actual creation of Transnational Multi-Model Ensemble (TMES)
Each script is invoked by the ingestion software with the current date as first argument (YYYMMDD)

See [tmes_rotate.py](https://github.com/CNR-ISMAR/tmes_ingestion/blob/master/tmes_rotate.py#L140) on line 140

The script location is by now on subdir bin of the working directory, other directories are declared inside script
